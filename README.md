# Wits Services

## Overview
A general purpose app with tools and functionality that will help a lot of Wits students everyday. 

Examples of services
•Campus Control - As mentioned above.
•Bus schedule - It's hard to find the PDF of the wits bus schedule so our app can host the schedule and allow for updates.
•Bus location - Students will get a live updates of where the enroute buses are, this will be really beneficial especially on Saturday in Rosebank mall.
•Dining Hall Menu - If you eat at the Wits Dining Hall everyday its a surprise you never know what you’ll eat, so the app can allow each dining hall to publish what’s on the menu and students will get to choose what to eat before they get to the dining area.
•Campus Health - Before you get to see a medical professional at Campus Health you must book a session, ur app can be used for bookings.
•CCDU - To book consultations. With Wits CCDU you get to see a professional you must book a session so they can allocate an appropriate person for your needs, our app can be used for bookings and allocations of staff.
•Events - Get to see all the events that happen at Wits and plan which one you want to attend.
